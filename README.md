# Error Detection Module

## Overview

This project introduces an **AI-powered Error Detection Module** that analyzes programming code and identifies potential issues without executing it. The system leverages the **Llama 3.2** language model, installed locally via the **Ollama framework**, ensuring data security while providing advanced error detection and improvement suggestions. A **Gradio-based interface** allows users to interact seamlessly with the model for real-time code analysis.

## Features

- **Gradio Interface**: A user-friendly platform for easy code input and analysis.
- **Error Detection Logic**: Uses **Llama 3.2** to detect syntax and logical errors.
- **Privacy-Focused**: Runs **locally** to prevent data leaks.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Detects errors in Python, JavaScript, C++, and Java.
- **Interactive Feedback**: Provides actionable suggestions for improvement.

## System Requirements

- **Software**: Python, Gradio, Llama 3.2, Ollama.
- **Hardware**: High-performance CPU/GPU recommended for faster processing.
